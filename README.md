# Frontend Mentor Challenge #1 

This is the first component challenge from frontendmentor.io where I was tasked to
create to mimic QR Code Component design with fixed parameters such as:
- Color
- Font
- Font-weight
- Font-size
- Mobile-Screen Dimensions

This challenge is the start of many entries so that I am able to polish my frontend skills
further.
